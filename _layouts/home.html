I'm interested in statistics and machine learning and their applications in science and engineering. I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at Princeton advised by <a href="https://beehive.cs.princeton.edu/">Barbara Engelhardt</a>. Previously, I studied Computer Science and Neuroscience at Brown University and worked at the <a href="http://cancerdatascience.org/">Broad Institute</a>.

I'm currently most interested in building statistical models that account for common types of structure in large datasets, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07977">such</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06731">as</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08411">group</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02879">structure</a>.

I also maintain a <a href="https://andrewcharlesjones.github.io/menu/blog.html">technical blog</a> where I focus on intuition-building, visualizations, and implementations for statistical ideas.
